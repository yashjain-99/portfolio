          Hey there! I'm Yash Jain, a software engineer currently working at RSL
          as a contractor for LinkedIn. With a knack for full stack development,
          I've journeyed through diverse industries, honing my skills along the
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey started with internships in different fields: from Data
          Engineering at Skilzen, to Data Science at RocketML, and Computer
          Vision at CarScan. These experiences taught me to tackle complex
          problems with clean, efficient code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's connect and discuss your next project over a cup of coffee (or
          virtual coffeeâ€”I'm flexible)!
        </p>
